# FeatureFlags

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/feature_flags`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

FeatureFlags.add_flags(flags)
```

# Check if the feature flag is enabled.
```ruby

  feature_flag :example_1, :search, :text_field, aria_label: "Search"  

  # Description:
  #   If the list_tag_modal is enabled, the if logic is enabled and the element will be located via aria_label.
  #
  # @param [String] value - The input value to search for.
  def search_for(value)
    if FeatureFlags.enabled?(:example_1)
      # Do something here if :list_tag_modal is enabled.
    end
    # Click on the modal here
    search_element.send_keys(value)
    
    # Printout the object to see what locator was used.
    puts search_element.inspect
  end
end # => end HomePage
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
